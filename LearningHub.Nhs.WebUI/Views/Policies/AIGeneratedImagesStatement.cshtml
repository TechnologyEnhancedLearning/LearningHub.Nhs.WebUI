                <p>This statement covers the use of  generative AI to create or enhance images, videos and alt text descriptions of images in the production of educational content by the NHS England (NHSE) Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) Content Development Team.</p>
                <p>This statement was prepared by the Generative AI Task And Finish Group on behalf of the Content Development Group and approved by the AI Steering Group and reflects the general principles we adhere to regarding the use of generative AI for the creation and enhancement of images.</p>
                <p>The statement will be reviewed regularly, to consider emerging tools and development of our full governance process  and policy, or every year, whichever is sooner.  </p>
                <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Statement of principles </h2>
                <p>The NHSE TEL Content Development Team is committed to providing high-quality learning content that improves patient care and provides the best value for taxpayers’ money. Our priority is to ensure accuracy, reliability and trustworthiness in all our educational resources while also improving the quality, speed and efficiency of learning content we produce.</p>
                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the use of digital technology to create systems capable of performing tasks commonly thought to require human intelligence. For more information on AI and its applications in the NHS, please refer to  <a href="https://transform.england.nhs.uk/ai-lab/" target="_blank">NHS AI Lab</a> and the  <a href="https://transform.england.nhs.uk/ai-lab/explore-all-resources/understand-ai/" target="_blank">NHSE AI Guide.</a> </p>
                <p>Generative AI is a category of AI which can produce content like text, images, music, special effects and video in response to a prompt from a human. Generative AI has the potential to improve the quality, speed or cost-effectiveness of image production.</p>
                <p>The NHSE TEL team has investigated the image generators currently available and concluded that images entirely generated by AI are not appropriate. However, we have found benefits that can support the content development process and enhance existing images. We are also mindful of the ethical implications of using image generators and carefully considered fairness for creators as well as value for taxpayers' money.</p>
                <p>While some images, videos or their text descriptions may be entirely created or enhanced by generative AI, all our educational content is verified by our team alongside relevant clinical and subject matter experts to check accuracy, relevance and guard against misrepresentation or misleading content.</p>
                <p>Please notify us of any factual errors or inaccuracies, or if you have any concerns regarding an image in this session by  <a href="https://support.learninghub.nhs.uk/support/home" target="_blank">contacting us through our support page.</a> </p>
                <p>General principles of use. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Images, videos or text descriptions entirely created or enhanced by generative AI will be used solely to enhance the learning experience. </li>
                    <li>mages, videos or text descriptions entirely created or enhanced by generative AI are intended for illustrative or decorative purposes and may not depict a real person, place or object.</li>
                    <li>Images, videos or text descriptions entirely created by generative AI may be used to generate visual concepts which are then used by inhouse designers to produce original content. </li>
                    <li> If a specific image, video or text description (not including background art) in the session is created entirely by generative AI, it will clearly be labelled with this information within the session.</li>
                    <li>If an image, video or text description is enhanced by generative AI (see below for examples) it will not be labelled, but a general statement will be added to the learning content. </li>
                    <li>The generative AI technologies we use are procured in strict adherence to our organisation’s information governance, procurement and cybersecurity guidelines, ensuring that all data and processes are secure. </li>
                    <li>We are committed to ensuring that the AI we use complies with our organisation’s equality and diversity guidelines. This means that we carefully evaluate these tools to ensure they do not perpetuate biases and are accessible to all users. </li>
                    <li>We are conscious of the ethical risks associated with the use of generative AI and are working to mitigate these through processes, principles, standards and guidance. </li>
                    <li>We are aware of the emerging consensus around copyright and generative AI and working closely with the   <a href="https://library.hee.nhs.uk/resources/copyright/using-copyright-materials-in-presentations-and-training" target="_blank"> Workforce, training and education Knowledge and Library Services to monitor this. </a> </li>
                    <li>We will not use AI to knowingly depict real people without consent and clear labelling to indicate the image or video is entirely generated by AI.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Examples of possible use of AI enhanced images </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Localisation (for example, the removal or replacement of a background to situate the content in an NHS setting).</li>
                    <li> To adhere to NHS standards (for example, the removal of long-sleeves and gloves, or tying back hair of medical staff in clinical situations).</li>
                    <li> To improve diversity and inclusivity (combine images to fully represent population). </li>
                    <li> Create diagrams or infographics. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> Examples of purely AI generated images   </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Backgrounds.</li>
                    <li>Abstract decorations, motifs and patterns. </li>
                </ul>
